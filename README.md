# Nowcado front end

This is a light weight Sinatra front end to the Nowcado API.  It showcases some of the user-facing features that are exposed.

### Main Features

* API calls are performed with rest-client for Ruby here, but anything that can read and push JSON will work.  See the Nowcado API documentation for more detailed examples with the various touch points using curl.
* The views use Twitter Bootstrap with the Cerulean theme.

### Issues & Feedback

If you have any problems or questions while developing your own custom front-end to the API, let us know!
